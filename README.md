# funfunmentorship

This project aims to pair people seeking to expand their knowledge with people willing to impart their wisdom.

To participate, edit your `hackable_json` to include a `mentorship` field with `seeking` and `offering` arrays, like so:

```json
{ "mentorship": { "seeking": [ "Rust", "Unity3D", "R" ], "offering": [ "VanillaJS", "Angular", "Drupal" ] }}
```

The app is hosted here: https://chemicalrocketeer.github.io/funfunmentorship/

## Contributing
Feel free to open up a PR, I have some features planned that I will be adding into the GitHub Projects page,
if you want to help with any of them feel free to participate.
There's lots of opportunities to build cool UI things on this project and I have had lots of ideas
that probably won't see the light of day due to lack of time.

I'm also not so good with making things stylish and flashy, so if you are into that be my guest.

When developing, you can run `npm start` to start up a dev server with hot reloading.
